# DSPy Community


This space is intended to be a space to highlight all of the awesome projects from the DSPy Community and to give us a central place as jumping off point when looking for DSPy Adjacent tooling.

## Libraries

### [attachments](https://github.com/MaximeRivest/attachments)
Attachments is a Python library that turns any file into model-ready text and images for LLMs in one line. It acts as a funnel for multimodal context, supporting PDFs, images, Office docs, web scraping, and more, with seamless DSPy integration and plugin extensibility.

### [dspy-profiles](https://github.com/nielsgl/dspy-profiles)
dspy-profiles is a companion tool for DSPy that manages configuration profiles via TOML files. It provides a CLI and Python API to switch between language models, retrieval settings, and environments, making DSPy projects more organized, secure, and reproducible.

### [dspy-spotlight](https://github.com/estsauver/dspy-spotlight)
DSPy Spotlighting is a production-ready defense against indirect prompt injection attacks in DSPy applications. It transforms untrusted input to help LLMs recognize and ignore malicious instructions, based on Microsoft Research, with methods like datamarking and encoding for robust security.

## Projects

### [cognitive-dissonance-dspy](https://github.com/evalops/cognitive-dissonance-dspy)
Cognitive Dissonance DSPy is a multi-agent LLM system for detecting and resolving belief conflicts. It translates formalizable claims to Coq and attempts machine-checked proofs, combining DSPy-based cognitive dissonance detection, NL-to-Coq translation, and online proving in one loop.
